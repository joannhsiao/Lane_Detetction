## pth download
https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternImage/resolve/main/upernet_internimage_xl_512x1024_160k_mapillary2cityscapes.pth \
put it in ./checkpoint_dir/seg/

## Usage

```python
from img_seg import *

image = "test.jpg"
right_line, left_line, direction, highest_point = img_seg(image)

```
  > right_line, left_line: both are a line, which type is [x1, y1, x2, y2]
  > 
  > direction: type is str
  >   
  > highest_point: type is [x, y]
